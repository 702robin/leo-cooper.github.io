        <p>
            Once a guy stood all day shaking bugs from his hair. The doctor
            told him there were no bugs in his hair. After he had taken a shower for
            eight hours, standing under hot water hour after hour suffering the pain of
            the bugs, he got out and dried himself, and he still had bugs in his hair; in
            fact, he had bugs all over him. A month later he had bugs in his lungs.</p>

            <p>Having nothing else to do or think about, he began to work out
            theoretically the life cycle of the bugs, and, with the aid of the _Britannica_,
            try to determine specifically which bugs they were. They now filled his
            house. He read about many different kinds and finally noticed bugs
            outdoors, so he concluded they were aphids. After that decision came to his
            mind it never changed, no matter what other people told him . . . like
            “Aphids don't bite people.”</p>

            <p>They said that to him because the endless biting of the bugs kept
            him in torment. At the 7-11 grocery store, part of a chain spread out over
            most of California, he bought spray cans of Raid and Black Flag and Yard
            Guard. First he sprayed the house, then himself. The Yard Guard seemed to
            work the best.</p>

            <p>As to the theoretical side, he perceived three stages in the cycle of
            the bugs. First, they were carried to him to contaminate him by what he
            called Carrier-people, which were people who didn't understand their role in
            distributing the bugs. During that stage the bugs had no jaws or mandibles
            (he learned that word during his weeks of scholarly research, an unusually
            bookish occupation for a guy who worked at the Handy Brake and Tire
            place relining people's brake drums). The Carrier-people therefore felt
            nothing. He used to sit in the far corner of his living room watching
            different Carrier-people enter--most of them people he'd known for a while,
            but some new to him--covered with the aphids in this particular nonbiting
            stage. He'd sort of smile to himself, because he knew that the person was
            being used by the bugs and wasn't hip to it.</p>

            <p>“What are you grinning about, Jerry?” they'd say.</p>
            <p>He'd just smile.</p>
            <p>In the next stage the bugs grew wings or something, but they really
            weren't precisely wings; anyhow, they were appendages of a functional sort
            permitting them to swarm, which was how they migrated and spread--
            especially to him. At that point the air was full of them; it made his living
            room, his whole house, cloudy. During this stage he tried not to inhale
            them.</p>
            <p>Most of all he felt sorry for his dog, because he could see the bugs
            landing on and settling all over him, and probably getting into the dog's
            lungs, as they were in his own. Probably--at least so his empathic ability
            told him--the dog was suffering as much as he was. Should he give the dog
            away for the dog's own comfort? No, he decided: the dog was now,
            inadvertently, infected, and would carry the bugs with him everywhere.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he stood in the shower with the dog, trying to wash the
                dog clean too. He had no more success with him than he did with himself. It
                hurt to feel the dog suffer; he never stopped trying to help him. In some
                respect this was the worst part, the suffering of the animal, who could not
                complain.</p>
            <p>“What the fuck are you doing there all day in the shower with the
                goddamn dog?” his buddy Charles Freck asked one time, coming in during
                this.</p>
            <p>Jerry said, “I got to get the aphids off him.” He brought Max, the
                dog, out of the shower and began drying him. Charles Freck watched,
                mystified, as Jerry rubbed baby oil and talc into the dog's fur. All over the
                house, cans of insect spray, bottles of talc, and baby oil and skin
                conditioners were piled and tossed, most of them empty; he used many cans
                a day now</p>
            <p>“I don't see any aphids,” Charles said. “What's an aphid?”</p>
            <p>“It eventually kills you,” Jerry said. “That's what an aphid is.
            They're in my hair and my skin and my lungs, and the goddamn pain is
                unbearable--I'm going to have to go to the hospital.”</p>
            <p>“How come I can't see them?”</p>
            <p>Jerry put down the dog, which was wrapped in a towel, and knelt
                over the shag rug. “I'll show you one,” he said. The rug was covered with
                aphids; they hopped up everywhere, up and down, some higher than others.
                He searched for an especially large one, because of the difficulty people had
                seeing them. “Bring me a bottle or jar,” he said, “from under the sink. We'll
                cap it or put a lid on it and then I can take it with me when I go to the doctor
                and he can analyze it.”</p>
            <p>Charles Freck brought him an empty mayonnaise jar. Jerry went on
                searching, and at last came across an aphid Jeaping up at least four feet in
                the air. The aphid was over aP inch long. He caught it, carried it to the jar,
                carefully dropped it in, and screwed on the lid. Then he held it up
                triumphantly. “See?” he said.</p>
            <p>“Yeahhhhh,” Charles Freck said, his eyes wide as he scrutinized
                the contents of the jar. “What a big one! Wow!”</p>
            <p>“Help me find more for the doctor to see,” Jerry said, again
                squatting down on the rug, the jar beside him.</p>
            <p>“Sure,” Charles Freck said, and did so.</p>
            <p>Within half an hour they had three jars full of the bugs. Charles,
                although new at it, found some of the largest.</p>
            <p>It was midday, in June of 1994. In California, in a tract area of
                cheap but durable plastic houses, long ago vacated by the straights. Jerry
                had at an earlier date sprayed metal paint over all the windows, though, to
                keep out the light; the illumination for the room came from a pole lamp into
                which he had screwed nothing but spot lamps, which shone day and night,
                so as to abolish time for him and his friends. He liked that; he liked to get
                rid of time. By doing that he could concentrate on important things without
                interruption. Like this: two men kneeling down on the shag rug, finding bug
                after bug and putting them into jar after jar.</p>
            <p>“What do we get for these,” Charles Freck said, later on in the day.
                “I mean, does the doctor pay a bounty or something? A prize? Any bread?”</p>
            <p>“I get to help perfect a cure for them this way,” Jerry said. The
                pain, constant as it was, had become unbearable; he had never gotten used
                to it, and he knew he never would. The urge, the longing, to take another
                shower was overwhelming him. “Hey, man,” he gasped, straightening up,
                “you go on putting them in the jars while I take a leak and like that.” He
                started toward the bathroom.</p>
            <p>“Okay,” Charles said, his long legs wobbling as he swung toward a
                jar, both hands cupped. An ex-veteran, he still had good muscular control,
                though; he made it to the jar. But then he said suddenly, “Jerry, hey--those
                bugs sort of scare me. I don't like it here by myself.” He stood up.</p>
                <p>“Chickenshit bastard,” Jerry said, panting with pain as he halted
                momentarily at the bathroom.</p>
            <p>“Couldn't you--”</p>
            <p>“I got to take a leak!” He slammed the door and spun the knobs of
            the shower. Water poured down.</p>
            <p>“I'm afraid out here.” Charles Freck's voice came dimly, even
            though he was evidently yelling loud.</p>
            <p>“Then go fuck yourself!” Jerry yelled back, and stepped into the
            shower. What fucking good are friends? he asked himself bitterly. No good,
             no good! No fucking good!</p>
            <p>“Do these fuckers sting?” Charles yelled, right at the door.</p>
            <p>“Yeah, they sting,” Jerry said as he rubbed shampoo into his hair.
            “That's what I thought.” A pause. “Can I wash my hands and get
            them off and wait for you?”</p>
            <p>Chickenshit, Jerry thought with bitter fury. He said nothing; he
            merely kept on washing. The bastard wasn't worth answering . . . He paid
            no attention to Charles Freck, only to himself. To his own vital, demanding,
            terrible, urgent needs. Everything else would have to wait. There was no
            time, no time; these things could not be postponed. Everything else was
            secondary. Except the dog; he wondered about Max, the dog.</p>
