            Once a guy stood all day shaking bugs from his hair. The doctor
            told him there were no bugs in his hair. After he had taken a shower for
            eight hours, standing under hot water hour after hour suffering the pain of
            the bugs, he got out and dried himself, and he still had bugs in his hair; in
            fact, he had bugs all over him. A month later he had bugs in his lungs.
            Having nothing else to do or think about, he began to work out
            theoretically the life cycle of the bugs, and, with the aid of the _Britannica_,
            try to determine specifically which bugs they were. They now filled his
            house. He read about many different kinds and finally noticed bugs
            outdoors, so he concluded they were aphids. After that decision came to his
            mind it never changed, no matter what other people told him . . . like
            “Aphids don't bite people.”
            They said that to him because the endless biting of the bugs kept
            him in torment. At the 7-11 grocery store, part of a chain spread out over
            most of California, he bought spray cans of Raid and Black Flag and Yard
            Guard. First he sprayed the house, then himself. The Yard Guard seemed to
            work the best.
            As to the theoretical side, he perceived three stages in the cycle of
            the bugs. First, they were carried to him to contaminate him by what he
            called Carrier-people, which were people who didn't understand their role in
            distributing the bugs. During that stage the bugs had no jaws or mandibles
            (he learned that word during his weeks of scholarly research, an unusually
            bookish occupation for a guy who worked at the Handy Brake and Tire
            place relining people's brake drums). The Carrier-people therefore felt
            nothing. He used to sit in the far corner of his living room watching
            different Carrier-people enter--most of them people he'd known for a while,
            but some new to him--covered with the aphids in this particular nonbiting
            stage. He'd sort of smile to himself, because he knew that the person was
            being used by the bugs and wasn't hip to it.</p>
