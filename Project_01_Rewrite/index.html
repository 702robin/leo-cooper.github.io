            Once a guy stood all day shaking bugs from his hair. The doctor
            told him there were no bugs in his hair. After he had taken a shower for
            eight hours, standing under hot water hour after hour suffering the pain of
            the bugs, he got out and dried himself, and he still had bugs in his hair; in
            fact, he had bugs all over him. A month later he had bugs in his lungs.</p>
